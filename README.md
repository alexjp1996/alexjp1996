ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marlon Jimenez

I like learning all themes related with new technologies, cloud computing, infrastructure as code, new programming languages, scrum framework, continuous integration
and continuous deployment, API Rest, microservices, containers and others. My favorite cloud company is Amazon Web Services.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn by myself:
- Docker and its application in rest API services
- Go programming language
- MongoDB
